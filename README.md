# WhereNot2Park-master

An Android based crowdsourced system that provides information about
free parking/paid spots in an area, to users from the data contributed
by other users.The crowd-sourced data was mined to identify request
patterns and areas that would benefit from dedicated parking
infrastructure.

Users can
1. Tag free parking spots they know
2. Request for free parking spots in an area ( Can be the current
location )

The nearest parking spots to the selected location are shown.
These requests for parking spots are visualized using Data Mining
Techniques to gain knowledge like which area's are most popular for
parking, where do the most requests originate from, etc.

The system uses
1. Google Maps API for tagging and displaying GPS coordinates.
2. OAuth for authentication
3. Google Fusion Tables for visualization
